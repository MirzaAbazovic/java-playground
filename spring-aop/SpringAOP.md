# Spring AOP

[Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) with Spring](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.5.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop)

## Aspect

Something to be executed on (before, after, around) some place (jointpoint) if defined by some expresion (pointcut). :) 
Class that implements the application concerns(logic) which cut through multiple classes: logging, transaction management, security, etc.
Aspects can be a normal class **configured through Spring XML configuration**.
It can also be regular classes **annotated using @Aspect annotation.**

## Joinpoint

A possible **point in the program** execution where an **aspect can be plugged in** (some place).
It could be a method that is being called, an exception being thrown, or even a field being modified, constructor etc.
**In Spring this can only be method.**

## Pointcut

An **expression** that is matched with **join points** to determine whether **advice** needs **to be executed** or not.

## Target Object

Objects on which advices are applied. In Spring AOP, a subclass is created at runtime where the target method is overridden
and advices are included based on their configuration.

## Proxy

It is an object that is created after applying advice to the target object.
In clients perspective, object, the target object, and the proxy object are same.

## Weaving

Process of linking an aspect with other application types or objects to create an advised object.

## Types of Advices

Several types of advices present in Spring AOP are as follows:

1. Before
2. After returning
3. After throwing
4. After (finally)
5. Around

Before - Here, advices execute before the joinpoint methods and are configured using **@Before** annotation mark.

After returning - These advice types execute after the joinpoint methods complete the execution normally. They are configured using **@AfterReturning** annotation mark.

After throwing - Here, advices execute only when the joinpoint method exits by throwing an exception. They are configured using **@AfterThrowing** annotation mark.

After (finally) -> In this case, advices execute after a joinpoint method executes, regardless of the methodâ€™s exit (whether normal or exceptional return). They are configured using **@After** annotation mark.

Around -> These advice types execute before and after a join point and are configured using **@Around** annotation mark.
